# Example question for Advanced Epidemiology Course

The following description is adapted from a published paper “Association of Indoor Air Pollution and Lifestyle with Lung Cancer in Osaka, Japan. International Journal of Epidemiology 1990, 19 (SuppI1): 562-566.” No need to read the paper, the relevant text (lightly adapted) is extracted below.

## Abstract (in full)

A hospital-based case-control study among non-smoking women was conducted to clarify risk factors in non-smoking females in Japan. Cases consisted of 144 non-smoking female lung cancer patients, and these were compared to 713 non-smoking female controls. The odds ratio (95% confidence interval) for use of wood or straw as cooking fuels when subjects were 30 years old was estimated as 1.77 (1.08 to 2.91). For those whose household members, other than husbands, had smoked, the odds ratio was estimated as 1.50 (1.01 to 2.32). For those whose mothers had smoked, the odds ratio was estimated as 1.28 (0.71 to 2.31). Use of heating appliances did not show an elevated risk. Some points to be noted in the study of low-risk agents for lung cancer are discussed.

## Excerpt  - methods

Both cases and controls were collected from those newly admitted to eight hospitals from 1 January, 1986 to 31 December 1988, and their ages ranged from 40 to 79 years at the time of hospitalization. Of the above eight hospitals, all wards for lung cancer and one or two wards for other diseases were involved in this study. All newly-admitted patients were investigated by a self-administered questionnaire at the time of admission to the hospital. A uniform questionnaire was used in all hospitals, designed specifically for this study, which included questions about smoking habits, exposure to environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) and exposure to possible indoor air pollution.

No matching procedures were conducted between cases and controls. Logistic regression analysis for the association between lung cancer and indoor air pollution was performed adjusting for the following variables:- age, education, other household members smoked in adulthood and mother smoked in childhood.

## Questions

1. Draw a causal diagram using the notation taught in lecture 3: include the exposure and outcome of interest, common sources (ie potential confounders) and common effects (ie colliders). For the purposes of this exercise assume that all variables, when measured, were measured accurately (eg smoking). Make sure that you indicate where the study has conditioned on a node (ie where it has employed restriction, stratification, matching or regression)

**I ADDED THIS SECOND QUESTION TO GIVE YOU EXPERIENCE OF WRITING A SHORT NOTE.**

2. Identify one open pathway through the diagram you have created and explain in plain language how the exposure and outcome might be associated (except via the causal pathway) (10 marks).
